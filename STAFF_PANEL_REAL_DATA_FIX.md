# Staff Panel Role & Permissions - Real Data Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

The role_permissions view in the staff panel was showing hardcoded/empty data instead of real database data due to a **field name error** in the Django ORM query.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

In `/workspaces/MetaTask/services/staff_panel/views.py` line ~744, the view was using an incorrect field name:

```python
# ❌ WRONG - This field doesn't exist
roles = Role.objects.filter(organization=organization).annotate(
    permission_count=Count('permissions'),
    user_count=Count('userroleassignment')  # <-- This is wrong!
)
```

The correct field name is `user_assignments`, not `userroleassignment`.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

Updated the view to use the correct field name:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT
roles = Role.objects.filter(organization=organization).annotate(
    permission_count=Count('permissions'),
    user_count=Count('user_assignments')  # <-- Fixed!
)
```

## 📊 **Real Data Now Displayed**

After the fix, the staff panel roles page now correctly shows:
