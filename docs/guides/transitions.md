# Workflow Transitions Guide

This guide explains how to manage workflow transitions using the visual Transitions Manager.

Key features:
- Single and bulk transition creation
- Four bulk patterns: Sequential, Hub-and-Spoke, Parallel Branches, Custom Selection
- Transition properties: label, conditions (JSON), permissions, visual customization
- Permissioned access: organization staff/admins

Usage:
- Open a workflow â†’ click "Manage Transitions"
- Use Add Transition for single transition or Bulk Create for patterns
- Edit or delete transitions from the manager

See `docs/design/transitions.md` for implementation and schema details.
