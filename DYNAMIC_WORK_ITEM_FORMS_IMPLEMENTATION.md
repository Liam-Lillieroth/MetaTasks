# Dynamic Work Item Forms - Complete Implementation âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

The CFlows work item creation system now **dynamically adapts** based on each workflow's field configuration, providing:

- **Conditional Field Display**: Only shows fields that are enabled for the workflow
- **Dynamic Required Validation**: Fields marked as required enforce validation
- **Custom Field Replacement**: Standard fields can be replaced with organization-specific custom fields
- **Responsive Form Generation**: Forms automatically adjust layout based on active fields

## âœ… **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

### **1. Enhanced WorkItemForm**
The `WorkItemForm` now intelligently adapts based on workflow configuration:

```python
class WorkItemForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, organization=None, workflow=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # Store workflow reference for field replacement logic
        self.workflow = workflow
        self.organization = organization
